## LFINANCE
It's an app where you can register your income and expenses, and see the total of transactions for  each month. More features soon :).<br>
You need to login with a Gmail account, so all your data will be saved, even if you change devices. Its stored with Firestore from Firebase(also hosted on it). <br>
This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React, which means it can be used on both desktop and smartphones and can be added to the home screen as an app, almost indistinguishable from a real native app.<br>
The stylization is all built with styled-components, so we can easily change themes and colors throughout the entire project.<br>
